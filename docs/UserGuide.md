   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

### Using Nuudle

This section will walk you through the layout of Nuudle. 


![UiMarkUp](images/UiMarkup.png)

The layout of Nuudle can be divided into 2 main areas:
1. The command execution area
2. The main viewing area

#### Executing command

The command execution area consists of the *Command Box* and the *Result Display Box*.

The *Command Box* is the area where you can type in your command and subsequently execute it by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
The result from the execution will then be displayed on the *Result Display Box*.

To get you started, here are some sample commands that you can try out:

1. **`help`** : Shows the help window. 

1. **`list`** : Lists all patients.

1. **`add`**` n/John Doe i/S9730284G p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to the Patient Book.

1. **`assign`**` 1 d/Tomorrow t/8.30am dur/30` : Creates an appointment for the 1st patient in the patient list for tomorrow 8.30am to 9am, assuming that the time slot is free.

1. **`view`**` d/Tomorrow` : Displays all appointment happening tomorrow.

1. **`cancel`**` 1` : Cancels the first appointment in the displayed appointment list.

1. **`clear`** : Deletes all patients and appointments.

1. **`exit`** : Exits the app.

To learn more about the various commands used in Nuudle, head down to our [Commands](#commands) section.


Alternatively, you can visit our [Command Summary](#command-summary) section to get a quick overview of Nuudle's commands.

#### Viewing the data

The main viewing area consists of the *Patient Book*, the *Appointment Book* and the *Appointment Overview*.

* The *Patient Book* contains information about the patients stored in Nuudle. Here we take a look at an entry in the Patient Book.
  ![PatientCard](images/PatientCard.png)
  
  * The *Patient Index* is a numbering system used in the Patient Book, which allows you to easily reference the patient by using the index shown.
  Throughout the document and the application, we use the term `PATIENT_INDEX` to refer to this Patient Index.

  * The *Medical Condition* here is a tag that help nurses easily identify any identified allergy, illness and more.
  This medical condition can be added as a tag when [adding a new patient](#adding-a-patient--add) or by [editing an existing patient](#editing-a-patient--edit).

  * The *Patient Details* are neatly displayed at the bottom for you to easily check and identify a patient.

<br>
* The *Appointment Book* contains details about the appointments created by Nuudle. Here we take a look at a single entry in the Appointment Book 
![AppointmentCard](images/AppointmentCard.png)

  * Similar to the Patient Index, the *Appointment Index* is a numbering system used in the Appointment Book.
  We use the term `APPT_INDEX` to refer to this Appointment Index.

  * Another important part of an appointment is the *Appointment Status*. There are four status types used in Nuudle and the meaning of each status is shown in the table below:

  **Appointment Status** | **Meaning**
  :---------------:|:----------------
  ![StatusDone](images/StatusDone.png) | A completed appointment that is marked as done using the `done` command
  ![StatusUpcoming](images/StatusUpcoming.png) | An uncompleted appointment that will be happening in the future.
  ![StatusOngoing](images/StatusOngoing.png) | An appointment that is currently ongoing but is still uncompleted.
  ![StatusExpired](images/StatusExpired.png) | An appointment that has already passed but is still uncompleted.

  * The *Patient Details* in the appointment entry provides the basic information of the patient, namely the name and the contact number.
  This allows you to easily keep track of who will be coming for the appointment and also call up the patient, if necessary.

<br>
* Lastly, the *Appointment Overview* provides simple statistics about the appointments stored in Nuudle.

  ![AppointmentOverview](images/AppointmentOverview.png)
  
  With it, you can: 
  * keep track of the total number of expected appointment for the day.
  * stay updated on the remaining number of appointments to be completed for the day.
  * get an estimate on how busy the clinic will be for the week

</div>


### General

#### Viewing help : `help`

Opens a new window which shows the commonly used commands, and a link to access the User Guide.

![Help Message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

#### Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the patient and appointment book to the state before the previous *undoable* command was executed.
`undo` command cannot reverse a command execution from the previous Nuudle session.
 
Format: `undo`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Tip:**
Undoable commands refers to commands that modifies the patient or appointment list contents. (**add**, **edit**, **delete**, **remark**, **assign**, **change**, **cancel**, **done** and **clear**)
</div>

* There must be at least one previously executed undoable command.
* Multiple calls to `undo` will reverse multiple undoable command execution, starting from the most recent command.

Examples:
* `delete 1`<br>
  `list`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command)

* `view d/today`<br>
  `list`<br>
  `undo`<br>
   The `undo` command fails as there is no previous undoable command to reverse.

* `cancel 1`<br>
  `clear`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `clear` command)<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)

Step-by-step illustration:
1. Initial state: <br>
![UndoCommandInitialState](images/UndoRedoInitialState_UG.png)

2. Input `delete 1`: <br>
![UndoCommandStep2](images/UndoStep2_UG.png) <br>
The first patient `Alex Yeoh` is deleted.

3. Input `undo`: <br>
![UndoCommandStep3](images/UndoStep3_UG.png) <br>
The `undo` command cancels the last undoable command `delete 1`, so that 
the patient `Alex Yeoh` comes back to the list again.

#### Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. `redo` command cannot reverse an `undo` execution from the previous Nuudle session.

Format: `redo`

* There must be at least one previously executed `undo` command.
* The previously executed `undo` command should be the most recent command that modifies the lists' data.
* Multiple call to `redo` will reverse multiple `undo` command, starting from the most recent `undo` command.

Examples:
* `cancel 1` <br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `list`<br>
  `redo` (reapplies the `cancel 1` command)

* `cancel 1`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `cancel 2`<br>
  `redo`<br>
   The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `cancel 1`<br>
  `clear`<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `clear` command)<br>
  `undo` (reverses the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `redo` (reapplies the `cancel 1` command)<br>
  `redo` (reapplies the `clear` command)

Step-by-step illustration:
1. Initial state: <br>
![RedoCommandInitialState](images/UndoRedoInitialState_UG.png)

2. Input `clear`: <br>
![RedoCommandStep2](images/RedoStep2_UG.png)

3. Input `Undo`: <br>
![RedoCommandStep3](images/RedoStep3_UG.png) <br>
All the data comes back.

4. Input `Redo`: <br>
![RedoCommandStep4](images/RedoStep4_UG.png) <br>
Redo the `clear` command, which removes all the data again.

#### Clearing all data : `clear`

Clears all appointment and patients entries.

Format: `clear`

Step-by-step illustration:<br>
1. Suppose you would like to clear the sample data to officially start using Nuudle from scratch, you can simply type in the command `clear` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.<br>
![ClearBefore](images/ClearCommand1.png)

2. All patient and appointment entries are cleared. You can now officially start adding your clinic's patient and appointment entries.<br>
![ClearAfter](images/ClearCommand2.png)

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits Nuudle.

Format: `exit`

#### Retrieving previously entered commands

By pressing the <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> arrow keys in the command box, you can cycle through the previously executed commands.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** You can use this feature together with `undo` command to correct a wrongly executed command. The steps below illustrate how this correction can be done:<br>

1. Use the `undo` command to first reverse the previous command execution.<br>

2. Next, use the <kbd>↑</kbd> arrow key in the command box to retrieve the original command.<br>

3. You can then edit the original command and execute it by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.<br>

<br>
With this feature, it saves you the hassle of having to retype the whole command again!
</div>

#### Saving the data

Nuudle automatically saves the patient and appointment data to your home folder after any changes are made to the data. There is no need for you to save manually.

#### Archiving past appointments

Nuudle automatically removes past appointments and saves them into an archive folder for your future reference. This is done automatically everytime you start up the Nuudle app.

The appointments are grouped by their appointment months and saved in respective Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files. These files can be opened and viewed using Excel.

#### Backing up the data

Nuudle also keeps a backup of your data files from the previous Nuudle session in a backup folder. The backup data will be updated everytime you start up the Nuudle app.

This backup allows you to completely revert your data to the previous session's data. This is especially useful if your data was unintentionally corrupted and you need to manually restore the data.
